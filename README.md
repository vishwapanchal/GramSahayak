### AI-Driven Participatory Governance Framework for Quality Assurance in Rural Infrastructure

---

## 🚀 Overview
India invests thousands of crores in rural development every year — but many projects remain incomplete, substandard, or only exist on paper.

**Gram-Sahayak** introduces **transparent, AI-based verification** to ensure that every sanctioned project is actually executed on the ground.

We align with **UN SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure** to enable smarter, trustworthy, and citizen-centric governance.

---

## 🎯 Problem We Solve
Traditional rural infrastructure monitoring suffers from:
- Manual verification → **easy to fake**
- Villagers unaware of budgets → **no transparency**
- Complaints stagnate → **no accountability**
- Top-down decision making → **projects waste funds**

This leads to **ghost projects**, corruption, and loss of public trust.

## 💡 Key Features
| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| AI-based image inspection (YOLOv8) | Detects road cracks, quality defects |
| GPS Geofencing verification | Confirms work location & legitimacy |
| NLP-powered community need analysis | Prioritizes projects villagers truly want |
| Automated escalation mechanism | Guarantees follow-up actions |
| Role-based dashboards | Transparency for citizens & officials |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React.js  
**Backend:** FastAPI  
**Database:** MongoDB  
**AI Models:** YOLOv8, BERT / LDA  
**Scheduler:** Celery / APScheduler  
**Deployment:** (To be added — Docker / Cloud)

---

## 🔄 Architecture (Phase-1)
1. Villagers raise issues & upload evidence
2. AI categorizes the request  
3. Officer assigns contractor
4. Contractor submits geo-tagged work photos
5. AI verifies progress & quality  
6. If unresolved → auto-escalated to higher officials

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
- **Zero Ghost Projects** through reliable validation  
- **Trustworthy infrastructure** funded by public money  
- **Inclusive planning** driven by villagers’ needs  
- **Faster grievance resolution** with auto follow-ups  

We make rural governance **transparent, accountable, and future-ready**.
